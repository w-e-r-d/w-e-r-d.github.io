        <h2>spotify keypad (spotipad)</h2>
        <p>why did i make this?</p>
        <p>i made this because when i'm at work i'm listening to spotify.  and i often am listening to new music, which i like to save into various playlists if i like the song.</p>
        <p>buuut it's a bit disruptive and distracting to leave the window i'm working in, move over to my other monitor, find the playlist i want to add the song to, and drag the song into it.</p>
        <p>so i made this keypad to store playlist ids.  that way without even lifting focus from my working window i can save whatever song i'm listening to into a number of presaved playlists via the keypad</p>

        <h4>how does it work?</h4>
            <p>keypad is built with raspberry pi pico and pimeroni led keypad kit, pico firmware is micropython, the listener software is python built into an exe, and the case is 3d printed</p>
            <p>i'll make a tutorial at some point, but i think it might be better as a video rather than a bunch of instructions like my <a href="/projects/sp_field_scanner" target="_blank">spotify field scanner</a> tutorial.  so it might take me a while to figure out the best way to do that
            <p>the firmware (just a .py file on the raspberry pi pico) sends instructions to a listener that lives in your system tray</p>
            <p>the listener communicates with spotify api or your computer depending what button you pressed (add to playlist vs skip/play/pause)</p>
