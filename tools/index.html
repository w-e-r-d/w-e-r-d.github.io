      <p>
        stumbling onto a wepage containing curated lists of hyperlinks (like kevin kelly's <a href='https://kk.org/cooltools/'>cool tools</a>) feels like christmas morning to me.
      </p>
      <p>
        so, this is my gift to some random internet nomad looking for cool, helpful sites and my contribution to making the web a bit smaller.
      </p>

      <section class="tools-list">
        <h3>design</h3>
        <ul>

            <li><a href="https://savee.com/" target=”_blank”>savee</a> | not a tool, but lots of inspiration.</li>

        <h3>utilities</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/index.html" target=”_blank”>nirsoft</a> | idk what 90% of the things this guy makes do, but he's a genius and you'll definitely find something useful on his site.  i use his system-wide searching utility quite often.</li>
            <li><a href="playphrase.me/#/search?language=en" target=”_blank”>playphrase</a> | this is just fun.  great for texting and groupchats.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.whatpoliticssay.com" target=”_blank”>what politics say</a> | same thing as playphrase but for politicians instead of movies.</li>
            <li><a href="https://jthatch.com/Terrain2STL/" target=”_blank”>terrain2stl</a> | if you like maps + 3d printing, this will be helpful.</li>
            <li><a href="https://freecampsites.net/" target=”_blank”>free campsites</a> | no description needed.</li>
            <li><a href="https://overpass-turbo.eu/index.html" target="_blank">overpass turbo</a> | query OSM data quickly and easily.</li>  
            <li><a href="https://www.flickr.com/people/britishlibrary/" target="_blank">british library</a> | lots of random, weird, but oddly cool assets on here for use or inspiration.</li>
            <li><a href="https://put.io/" target="_blank">put io</a> | file hosting **and downloading** service.  ahoy matey!</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>spotify/music</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://everynoise.com/engenremap.html" target="_blank">everynoise</a> | glenn mcdonald, the goat of spotify, built this site.  he's a legend and inspired me to get into spotify API and music discovery.  his site is awesome, and there's so much stuff on it, beyond this page.  i encourage you to poke around, but at least check out <a href="https://everynoise.com/curio.html" target="_blank">curio</a> and <a href="https://everynoise.com/nrbg.html" target="_blank">NRbG</a>.</li>
            <li><a href="https://skiley.net/" target="_blank">skiley</a> | fav feature: "discover unkown songs" - pulls songs with low popularity by a chosen artist.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.music-map.com/" target="_blank">gnod</a> | music map is my favorite tool here, but gnod also has other tools worth checking out.</li>
            <li><a href="https://kworb.net/spotify/" target="_blank">kworb</a> | leaderboard for spotify, itunes, yt, radio, etc.  super cool data.</li>
            <li><a href="https://everynoise.com/" target="_blank">everynoise</a> | genre map of spotify.  super cool to explore.</li>
            <li><a href="https://stats.fm/" target="_blank">stats fm</a> | this might be my favorite one.  use it daily.  kind of buggy, but it's come a long way and is a big deal these days.</li>
            <li><a href="https://web.swipefy.app/home" target="_blank">swipefy</a> | tinder but for discovering music.  buggy, but fun when it works. made by the same guy as stats fm.</li>
            <li><a href="https://exportify.net/" target="_blank">exportify</a> | it's in the name.  export playlists to .csv for analytics.  especially cool because since this has been around a while, it has access to some track metadata that spotify API no longer supports.</li>
            <li><a href="https://nickwanders.com/projects/ng-spotify-importer/" target="_blank">NG spotify importer</a> | opposite of exportify.  it imports .csv to playlist.  so after you've done your sorting/filtering/analysis on the .csv you can re-import to a playlist.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.obscurifymusic.com/home" target="_blank">obscurify</a> | fun site that shows you how your music taste compares to the general population of listeners (by country, if you want) in terms of obscurity.</li>
            <li><a href="https://discoverquickly.com/" target="_blank">discover quickly</a> | LOVE this tool.  super helpful if you're scanning playlists for new songs.  just hover on the album art to hear preview.  so helpful for sorting through 100+ songs in less than 10 min.</li>
            <li><a href="https://whisperify.net/" target="_blank">whisperify</a> | turns your spotify library/top tracks into a little trivia game.  pretty fun, especially when you compete against friends.</li>
            <li><a href="https://wgo.signal11.org.uk/wgo.htm" target="_blank">what goes on</a> | a list of every single anomaly in the beetles' discography.  only cool if you're a beetles superfan or know a beetles superfan.</li>
            <li><a href="https://bandle.app/menu" target="_blank">bandle</a> | wordle but for music.  pretty fun but i suck at it.</li>
            <li><a href="https://aquariumdrunkard.com/" target="_blank">aquarium drunkard</a> | "eclectic audio journal" as they, fittingly, describe themselves.  i enjoy their mixtapes quite a bit.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.birp.fm/" target="_blank">birp!</a> | another audio journal curated by a guy named josh.  monthly playlists with new indie music.  found some good music through josh.</li>
            <li><a href="https://mopidy.com/" target="_blank">mopidy</a> | super customizable music server in python.  i have yet to actually use this, but i have some cool ideas.  definietly worth checking out.</li>
            <li><a href="https://jamocracy.io/" target="_blank">jamocracy</a> | it's like a spotify jam but for a bunch of people (i.e. a party) where everyone can add to the queue and upvote/downvote songs in the queue to play them sooner/later.</li>
