        spools is a utility for spotify power users.  it's goal is to make analytics, discovery, and organization more accessible and efficient.
      </p>
      <p>
        you can download a primitive version below.  it's not pretty, but it *should* work. i may eventually update it, i've got some new features/tools ready, i just haven't bothered to re-build it since i'm working on a web-app version.
      </p>
      <p>
        it's not intuitive, and i have no documentation on how to use it.  but if you'd like to try it, please email me or message me on linkedin and i'll help you set it up. or ask chatGPT, it can probably help you set up your API credentials.

      <p>
        note: it only works on windows and may have unresolved bugs.  it can also be destructive to your spotify library if you don't know what you're doing.
      </p>
      <p>
        if you use it, please let me know if you have any suggestions/feedback.  would love to hear as i build the web app version.
